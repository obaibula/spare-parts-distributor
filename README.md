It acts as an interface between the client and the back-end services.
- Service: Implements the business logic and provides services to handle specific operations, 
such as managing inventory, processing sales, and managing customer relationships.
- Repository: Handles the persistence and retrieval of data from the underlying database. 
It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the data storage.

to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency. These include:

- PostgreSQL
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3
- REST
- Spring HATEOAS
- Spring Data
- Flyway
- Validation
- Testcontainers
- Spring Security, and more.

## Additional Information
### A Few Words about Interfaces for Single Service Classes

I acknowledge that using an interface for every single class is considered bad practice.
However, using concrete classes instead of interfaces causes Spring to use Cglib instead of
the native API, which is considered the preferred approach in the Spring documentation.
Therefore, I have chosen to use interfaces even for a single class.
